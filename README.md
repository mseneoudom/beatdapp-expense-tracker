beatdapp expense tracker

This web application will allow the user to access and enter an expense tracker which will store in a database. 
The expense tracker will allow the user to add a title to the expense, a value, and select a category.
Once ready, hit the submit button and the expense will be saved!

To delete any expenses, you can click the delete button which will delete the expense in the section clicked.

This repository uses:
- Firebase Database
- Bootstrap (Although used, I much prefer not using a CSS framework!)
- SASS and Live SASS Compiler
- JQuery (CDN)
- Google Fonts (CDN)

To run the web app, simply click index.html, fill out the form, and add your expense!
